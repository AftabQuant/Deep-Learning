In this repository, I learned and practiced my deep learning course on the youtube.
This repo contains different types of neural networks algorithm like
1. Single Layer Perception.
2. Multi Layer Perceptron (ANN).
3. Convolutional Neural Network.

Different methods to improve the models performance:
1. BackPropagation
2. Loss Function
3. Activation Function
4. Regularization Technique
5. Optimizers
6. Batch Normalization
